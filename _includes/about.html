        <p>
          Resurrect Bio is a plant biotech start-up, based in London. We are working on how to improve the immune system of crop species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crops were bred over generations by plant breeders to improve key traits such as yield, height or drought-tolerance, but sometimes inadvertently lost key immune resistance genes (<i>R</i>-genes).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Additionally, modern monocultures are static in evolution, but the pests and pathogens that threaten them are not. </p>
        <p>
          Plant diseases are constantly evolving new ways of defeating the <i>R</i>-genes in crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate change is making matters worse – diseases are spreading to new locations, meaning the disease spectrum farmers are dealing with is expanding.
