    Background: 

    Our crops were bred over generations by plant breeders to be higher yielding, but sometimes inadvertently lost key immune resistance genes (R-genes). 
    Nowadays, our monocultures are static in evolution, but the pests and pathogens are not. They constantly evolve new ways of defeating plant R-genes. 

    Mission:
    We will resurrect R-genes to make our crops great again. 

    Technology:
    We will leverage our unique understanding of the immune receptor networks in plants and pathogen effector biology, to fix the immune system of our crop species. 

    Goal 1 - reSOYrrect:
    $1.5 billion dollars of yield is lost to soybean cyst nematode in the US alone, every year. This microscopic worm-like insect has no effective chemical control for use in the US market. We will use gene editing to resurrect defeated resistance genes in soy, allowing it to defend itself. 

    Goal 2 - To be announced
    We will reduce crop losses due to disease on several crop plants, without the need for spraying harmful agrichemicals.
