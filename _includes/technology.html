            Recent breakthroughs allow us to reconstitute networks of immune receptors in our model species.

            We use fast-forward techniques that give us results in days, not years.

            We will leverage our unique understanding of the immune receptor networks in plants and pathogen effector
            biology, to fix the immune system of our crop species.

              Diseases in soy are devastating for sustainable farming, for instance $1.5 billion dollars of yield is
              lost to soybean cyst nematode in the US alone, every year. This microscopic worm-like parasite has no
              effective chemical control for use in the US market.
