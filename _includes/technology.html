    Can have something at the start  about sustainable agriculture too

    e.g. Sustainable Agriculture [heading]
    -reduce pesticides
    -increase farmer yields

    => reducing CO2/GHG emissions from farming
    

    And why genetic control is better than chemical control of pathogens/pests
    
    -more precise, i.e. only kills bad microbes that are actually eating the crop, leaves the rest alone
    -no leakage and accumulation of chemicals into the soil or environment, our system only uses the plant's own immune system to attack the microbe, we just fine tune it to recognise the pathogens again
    -better for climate crisis as no fossil fuel based chemicals involved
    -our technology will increase genetic diversity of crops, not diminish it, i.e. tailor made solution for each crop and disease
    -no foreign DNA introduced - our solution can be achieved through gene editing of the crop's own DNA
    -robust disease resistance, we can predict how the pathogen will evolve to overcome our disease control measures
