            Recent breakthroughs allow us to reconstitute networks of immune receptors in our model species.

          <li>
            These fast-forward techniques give us results in days, not years.

          <li>
            We will leverage our unique understanding of the immune receptor networks in plants and pathogen effector biology, to fix the immune system of our crop species.
